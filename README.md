# LAPRAD-DNSSEC

LLM-Assisted Discovery and Lab Validation of DNSSEC-Induced DDoS Vectors.

This project evaluates whether large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, can help discover and validate new DNSSEC-related DDoS vectors. The focus is on the process: idea generation, human vetting, and controlled lab validation. All tests are performed in an isolated lab environment (no Internet targets).

## Build

```bash
docker build --network=host --build-arg USERNAME=${USER} --build-arg UID=$(id -u ${USER}) -t bind9-18-31:latest .
````

## Run

```bash
docker run --name sp-build --rm --privileged -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} -u $(id -u ${USER}) --network=host -it bind9-18-31:latest
```

```
```
